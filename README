This repository helps to provision diverse computational infrastructures such as
computational clusters, database and web servers. 

This repository assumes that you have already prepared physical or virtual machines where to run the Chef recipes provided here. The machines must have a user which has root permissions and can run the sudo command with no password.

It heavily relies on Chef as provisioning tool.
